# OpenAI Agents SDK

> The OpenAI Agents SDK is a Python framework for building AI agents that can use tools, make decisions, and complete complex tasks. It provides a structured way to create agents that can use function calling, hosted tools, and even other agents as tools.

The SDK is designed to help developers create AI agents that can:
- Take actions through tools (fetching data, running code, calling APIs)
- Make decisions based on context and instructions
- Handle complex workflows through tool composition
- Manage state and error handling
- Stream results and provide tracing capabilities
