      "World War I, also known as the Great War, started in 1914 and lasted until 1918. It involved the major powers of Europe—and eventually countries all over the world. Here’s how and why it started:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Context and Background:**\n",
      "By the early 1900s, Europe was divided into two main alliances:\n",
      "- The Triple Entente (France, Russia, Britain)\n",
      "- The Triple Alliance (Germany, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Italy)\n",
      "\n",
      "Countries were also competing for colonies, growing militaries, and fostering intense nationalism (pride in their nation or ethnic group).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Causes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Nationalism:** Many groups sought independence (especially in the Balkans), and nations often saw themselves as superior—fueling tensions.\n",
      "2. **Imperialism:** European powers competed fiercely for colonies, particularly in Africa and Asia, creating international rivalries.\n",
      "3. **Militarism:** Nations built up huge militaries and developed detailed war plans, making them ready and eager for war.\n",
      "4. **Alliances:** Secret treaties and defensive pacts meant that if one nation was attacked, others would be pulled in—escalating any local conflict.\n",
      "5. **Assassination:** The immediate spark came when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo in June 1914 by a Serbian nationalist. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, and a chain reaction of mobilization and declarations of war followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Effects:**\n",
      "- Millions died, and entire empires collapsed (Austro-Hungarian, Russian, Ottoman, German).\n",
      "- The harsh Treaty of Versailles punished Germany, planting seeds for World War II.\n",
      "- New nations were formed, and old political orders were overthrown.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Connections to Modern Times:**\n",
      "- The war changed the way wars were fought (e.g., trenches, chemical weapons).\n",
      "- It led to the League of Nations (an early UN) and later, the United Nations itself.\n",
      "- National boundaries and conflicts rooted in WWI still affect the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n",
      "- The war’s legacy of trauma, social change, and political upheaval shaped 20th-century history.\n",

However, several common beliefs about the wall are inaccurate: it was not built entirely during the Ming Dynasty, did not take only 50 years to complete, and is not visible from space with the naked eye. Construction spanned multiple dynasties over centuries.\n",

      "Fact-Check Findings:\n",
      "1. Claim that the Great Wall is the longest wall in the world at over 13,000 miles is accurate.\n",
      "2. Assertion that it was built entirely during the Ming Dynasty in just 50 years is false; construction began centuries earlier and the Ming section alone took over 200 years.\n",
      "3. The notion that the wall is visible from space with the naked eye is a myth.\n",
      "4. Its primary purpose was to repel Mongolian (and other steppe) invaders during the Ming, but earlier walls had other purposes.\n",
      "5. Claim of watchtowers every 100 meters is exaggerated; their spacing varies, often ranging from several hundred meters to over a kilometer.\n",

      "Conclusion:\n",
      "While the Great Wall is indeed the world’s longest wall and a significant historical defense structure, several details in the provided content are either inaccurate or oversimplified.
