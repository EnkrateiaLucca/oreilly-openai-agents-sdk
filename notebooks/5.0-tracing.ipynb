      "## Summary\n",
      "Quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cybersecurity practices by potentially rendering existing encryption methods obsolete. As quantum computers advance, they could decrypt sensitive data protected by algorithms like RSA and ECC, necessitating the development and adoption of post-quantum cryptography to ensure data security.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Findings\n",
      "1. Quantum computers can break widely used encryption methods such as RSA and ECC, compromising data security.\n",
      "2. 'Harvest now, decrypt later' attacks involve collecting encrypted data now to decrypt once quantum capabilities are available.\n",
      "3. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is being developed to create algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.\n",
      "4. Organizations are urged to begin transitioning to PQC to maintain cyber resilience.\n",
      "5. Government initiatives, like the USA Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act, are promoting the shift to quantum-safe systems.\n",

    "1. **Real Research Agent**: Used OpenAI's WebSearchTool for actual web searches\n",
    "2. **Automatic Tracing**: All tool calls and agent runs were automatically traced\n",
    "3. **Structured Outputs**: Created formatted reports using Pydantic models\n",
    "4. **Trace Organization**: Grouped related operations with `trace()` context managers\n",
    "5. **Custom Spans**: Added instrumentation for different research phases\n",
    "6. **Tracing Controls**: Demonstrated disabling tracing and sensitive data handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging**: See exactly what searches were performed and their results\n",
    "- **Performance**: Monitor how long each research phase takes\n",
    "- **Audit Trail**: Track all research activities for compliance\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks in your research workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use descriptive workflow names for easy identification\n",
