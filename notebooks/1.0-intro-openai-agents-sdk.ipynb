    "# Introduction to [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions. \n",
    "- Small set of primitives:\n",
    "  - Agents: LLMs equipped with instructions and tools\n",
    "  - Handoffs: allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks\n",
    "  - Guardrails: enable validation of agent inputs and outputs\n",
    "  - Sessions: automatically maintains conversation history across agent runs\n",
    "\n",
    "It also includes **built-in tracing**: lets you visualize and debug your agentic flows, as well as evaluate them and even fine-tune models for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2 design principles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enough features to be worth using, but few enough primitives to make it quick to learn.\n",
    "2. Works great out of the box, but you can customize exactly what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent loop: Built-in agent loop that handles calling tools, sending results to the LLM, and looping until the LLM is done.\n",
    "- Python-first: Use built-in language features to orchestrate and chain agents, rather than needing to learn new abstractions.\n",
    "- Handoffs: A powerful feature to coordinate and delegate between multiple agents.\n",
    "- Guardrails: Run input validations and checks in parallel to your agents, breaking early if the checks fail.\n",
    "- Sessions: Automatic conversation history management across agent runs, eliminating manual state handling.\n",
    "- Function tools: Turn any Python function into a tool, with automatic schema generation and Pydantic-powered validation.\n",
    "- Tracing: Built-in tracing that lets you visualize, debug and monitor your workflows, as well as use the OpenAI suite of evaluation, fine-tuning and distillation tools."
